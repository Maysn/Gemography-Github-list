I made this project using React, was thinking about using Redux as well but this project's state didn't seem too complicated
and so i decided against using Redux here.

Before starting I tried breaking the big picture into smaller tasks and solve them one task at a time.

Mainly they were two tasks:
1- Making a function that detects when the user scrolls all the way to the end.
2- Fetching and rendering the next page when the user scrolled to the bottom of the list.

After the logic was done, I started working on styling it. Began by doing mobile design first, and then
added some mixins for bigger screen sizes to have it responsive and looking good on different screen sizes,
and then i tried picking my colors, and thought about adding a background color to both "Stars" and "Issues"
to make them more noticeable for the user.
